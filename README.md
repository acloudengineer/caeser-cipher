# caeser-cipher

A simple program to encode and decode messages with the caesar-cipher.

Aside from what's available I looking to figure out out to restart from the begining of a list, if a loop takes me out of range.
In this case if a letter is z and the cipher takes it to the next out of range it goes back to the beginning and the a to continue counting
